# Project Title: Girls in Hockey: USA Hockey Membership Statistics Analysis
Overview:
This project aims to evaluate the trends in enrollment of girls in youth hockey within the United States. With the growth of hockey within the United States and the recent inaugural season of the PWHL, identifying markets and age groups where youth hockey initiatives are flourishing and those where it is struggling provides key insight into the health and future of the sport. With USA Hockey initiatives having a focus on girls' enrollment, it is important to evaluate trends in enrollment and perform comparative analysis to the growth in registrations of both boys and girls to better direct focus and resources to key markets.

Project Structure:
Data Extraction and Preparation:
Utilized Okular and Excel to transform PDF reports into CSV format.
Leveraged Jupyter Notebooks and Python for automation and data manipulation.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted descriptive statistics to understand the distribution of hockey registrations across different age groups and genders.
Utilized time series analysis to identify trends and seasonal patterns in registration data.

Statistical Testing:
Performed regression analysis to assess the relationship between total players and girl players in hockey registrations.
Conducted comparative analysis to identify demographic differences and percentage variations.

Practical Significance Evaluation:
Assessed the impact of the findings on recruiting initiatives, identification of underperforming markets, and support for college and women's hockey recruitment.

Visualizations:
Employed bar charts, line charts, and regression plots to visually compare growth percentages, trends, and registration numbers across different categories.

Recommendations:
Proposed recommendations based on the analysis results, including strategic recruitment initiatives and targeted investment strategies.
Suggested updating the analysis with the latest data to evaluate the impact of the PWHL inaugural season on registration numbers.
